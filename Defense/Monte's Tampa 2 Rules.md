Using [[Brett Kollmann]]'s breakdown of [[Monte Kiffin]]'s [[Tampa 2]]  (named for the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] where the call was popularized), we can learn more about how Kiffin defenses are designed and who all uses them.

To begin with, we open up the conversation with [[Cover 3]]. In this particular example, we use a "base" [[Cover 3]] call to demonstrate the pass coverage distribution. Then, we discuss how the coverage at a functional level works. 
 - Cover 3 is called to keep a numbers advantage in the box while allowing 3 Deep Zone defenders (2 corners with outside leverage, and the Free Safety) to stop any play action passes that would be going deep. 
 - Cover 3 Weakness is crossing routes behind the Mike Linebacker, but in front of the Free Safety as he has to stay deep to provide help to the Corners playing with Outside Leverage. 
 - "Buzz" defenders are used to cover the Flat zone, 
 - Hook Zones are typically defended from inside leverage from the Sam as to restrict any in-breaking routes. 
 - Out Breaking Routes are covered by the corner as they play with outside leverage with either a Safety or a Hook Zone Defender playing inside of them. 

Cover 3 Protects Deep Outbreaking Routes with Outside Leverage from the Corners
Cover 2 Protects Deep Outbreaking Routes with Safeties with Inside Leverage. 
Tampa 2 Uses the Mike Linebacker to carry their receiver up to the Safeties, before playing any in-breaking routes with inside leverage. This leaves both Field and Boundary Corner to play underneath since the Safeties cover the Outside Receivers, and the Mike Linebacker covers any in breaking routes. 


This results in a 3 Deep, 4 Underneath Coverage Distribution showing that you can 

Once we cover how it works at "base", we introduce the concept of [[Nick Saban]]'s [[Cover 3 Mable]] coverage call. We do this to discuss how Cover 3 calls evolved since 2003 to reduce the shortcomings when handling the more popular 3 by 1 receiver alignments.  
- In this instance, the Field Corner is locked in Man Coverage against his receiver. 
- The Mike Linebacker will play man on the 3rd receiver from the outside if he has an inbreaking route that covers the middle of the field. 
- The Free Safety shades over to the passing strength to play a half zone shaded to the 3 receiver set. 
- The Strong Safety will play the Hook Zone as the Sam Linebacker is playing the Flat Zone.
- The Boundary Corner is playing a Deep Zone with the Nickle Corner covering the zone between the Flat Zone and the Deep Zone.
- Since the Strong Safety is coming down to play in the Hook Zone, he can also be used within the run fit to maintain even or positive numbers within the box. 



These modifications are made to allow for the Free Safety to have better leverage to the passing strength while also covering the primary weakness of [[Base Cover 3]] by having a Mike Linebacker take away the crossing lane.

Now, why have we spent so much time talking about Cover 3 when we are talking about a Cover 2 Structure? Well, according to the rules in which Monte Kiffin established the Tampa 2 on, it is meant to be played more like a Cover 3 than it is like a traditional Cover 2 system. This leads into our discussion into why. While Cover 3 allows for you to keep a numbers advantage in the box, Cover 2 does not use the Safeties in the run fit. Cover 2 rules are as follows:
- Cover 2 is called with 2 Deep Zone defenders (both Safeties) to provide more support on Passing plays. 


This was an issue in the early years of the Kiffin Tampa 2 since, in the early 2000s, there was a larger emphasis on rushing than on passing. As such, Tampa 2 was developed to work as a compromise in which, pre-snap it would read as Cover 2, but the Mike Linebacker would play the Center Zone between the Hashes eliminating any routes that would target the middle underneath the 2 Deep Zones.  This change in assignment meant that Kiffin could still get the same Pass Coverage distribution of 3 Deep 4 Underneath, but the landmarks they would reach would be much more favorable against passing concepts that targeted the weak point of Cover 2 at the cost of a weaker run fit. As such, Kiffin only utilized the Tampa 2 in obvious passing situations in which he could beat the offense with coverage rather than relying on a blitz. 

This would serve as a mid point between Cover 2 and Cover 3 in which, it would beat In-breaking routes using the Mike Linebacker sinking in coverage from a Cover 2 alignment by using 3 Deep 4 Underneath Coverage Distributions.

As such, Kiffin and Kiffin's Coaching Tree (including [[Pete Carroll]], [[Mike Tomlin]], [[Gus Bradley]], [[Lovie Smith]]) would use a small sampling of plays to structure their whole defense around. This sequence would go as follows:
	1st Down: Cover 3 to stop the run and get into a long yardage situation
	2nd and Long: Tampa 2 to beat the offense with coverage.
	3rd and Long: Show Blitz and choose to either bring the blitz or drop into Tampa 2. 

This simplifies the thinking process since you can simplify the defensive playbook to: 
	[[Tampa 2]]
	[[Cover 3]]
	[[Man Blitz]]
	[[Zone Blitz]]
	3rd Down Contingencies
