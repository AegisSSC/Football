## Venables Defensive Front Terminology:
Left/Right: The Mike always gives the direction call. This call tells the nose to align in the "A" to the Call and the "3" Technique to line away. In our 3-Man Fronts, Mike will declare the call to the field or if the ball is in the middle of the field, to the formation strength. 
Base Alignment Rules:
	- Sam, Nickel, Strong Safety, and Wide Corner: Align to the Field or into the Formation Strength
	- Will, Free Safety, and Boundary Corner: Align to the Boundary or away from the Formation Strength

Field: Defensive Front is called to the Wide side of the field. The "3" Technique aligns to the Boundary

Bench: The Defensive Front is called to the Short Side of the field. The "3" Technique aligns to the Field

Over: The Defensive Front is called away from the Tight End. Nose aligns away from the Tight End while the "3" Technique aligns to the Tight End

Wide: Modifier that tells the Defensive End away from the call to align in a "9" Technique

Solid: Modifier that tells the Defensive End away from the call to align in a "5" Technique and the Sam to Align in a "9" Technique over the Tight End

Tiger: The Defensive Front is called to have 2 "2i" Tackles. Nose aligns to the call and the Tackle aligns away from the call. 

Gut: The Defensive Front is called to have 2 "2" Technique Tackles . Nose aligns to the call, and the Defensive Tackle aligns away from the call. 

Even: The Defensive Front is called to have 2 "3" Technique Tackles. Nose aligns to the call, and the Defensive Tackle aligns away from the call. 

Eagle: Term to align in Under Front. Use only vs. 21-12-22 personnel teams. To the Tight End side, the nose aligns at "2i", the Defensive End aligns in a "5" Technique, and the Sam aligns in a "9" technique. In Eagle defense, the corners match up with the Wide Receivers. 

Eagle Cheat: Variation of Eagle in which the Defensive Tackle away from the call aligns in "4i" and the Nose aligns in a Shade. 

Bear: Front called to have a "0" Nose over the Center and 2 "3" Techniques covering the guard, creating a  5,6, or 7 man surface vs. offensive sets. Bear Fronts can be created with either of the 3 Linebackers aligning on the end of the Line of Scrimmage based upon Game plan (Bench = Will, Field = Sam)

Okie: 3-4 Defensive Alignment. We can get to this Alignment from base personnel or either by subbing out a defensive lineman for a skill player. The call will be made to the field or if the ball is in the middle of the field, to the formation strength. The defensive ends aligned over the Offensive Tackles will play a "Heavy 5" Technique, while the Jack aligns into the Boundary away from the call. 

Dime: 3-4 Defensive Alignment. We can get to this Alignment from base personnel or either by subbing out a defensive lineman for a skill player. The Call will be made to the Field or if the ball is in the middle of the field, to the formation strength. The Defensive Ends Aligned over the Offensive Tackles will play "5" Techniques, while the Jack aligns into the Boundary away from the call. 

Goal-line Tiger G: A Specific Goal-line Front used vs. 22-23 Personnel. It is a "6" man surface with 2 "2i" Techniques, 2 "5" Technique Defensive Ends, and 2 "9" Technique Sam Linebackers

Cub: Front called to have a "0" Nose over the Center and 2 "3" Techniques covering the guard, creating a 5, 6, or 7 man surface vs. offensive sets. Ce can create the cub front with either of th3 3 linebackers aligning as one of the "3" Techniques based upon the game plan. (Bench = Will, Field = Sam)
