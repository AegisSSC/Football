The most common variation is [Cover 1 Robber](https://weeklyspiral.com/2020/10/28/how-the-chicago-bears-defense-confuses-qbs-into-making-mistakes-and-taking-sacks/). Robber starts out with two safeties at the snap of the ball and then rotates the strong safety down into the middle of the field to “rob” routes. This disguise can get the offense into a disadvantageous call and force the quarterback to read the coverage and diagnose things post-snap. It allows for players with ball skills to come down unexpectedly and attack routes in the middle of the field or help to double star receivers in combination with the defender that’s in man coverage on them.
