Cover 1 is a [[Defensive Coverage]]  scheme in which there is only a single safety that sits in the center of the field. 

Cover 1 utilizes one free safety in the middle of the field with underneath defenders in man coverage. If not blitzing, that leaves the defense one extra defender as a free player. That player can play multiple roles, like run support, bracketing a receiver, or robbing the middle of the field.


## Cover 1 Philosophy

[Cover 1 defenses](https://weeklyspiral.com/2021/06/03/film-breakdown-of-jeffrey-okudahs-rookie-year/) rely heavily on the athletic ability and performance of their corners and linebackers in coverage. Since there is only one safety, there is minimal help over the top which can lead to big plays if corners or defenders get beat. However, it also creates smaller windows for the quarterback to throw into and allows the defense to bring blitzes while making sure to have someone for every eligible receiver. In many instances, corners and underneath defenders will press receivers to disrupt timing and allow the pass rush to get home.

With defenders having their backs turned in man coverage, interceptions don’t happen very often in Cover 1. However, it does provide the ability to disguise and the flexibility to match whatever personnel are on the field.


## Cover 1 Assignments

There are many variations of Cover 1 and each team has different calls for different assignments for the free player on the defense. Here are the assignments for a base Cover 1:

#### Corners:
-   No run responsibility
-   Man-to-man on the #1 receiver

#### Free Safety:
-   No run responsibility
-   Split the difference on vertical routes
-   Use pattern recognition to key off route combinations
-   Read the quarterback’s eyes

#### Nickel / Outside Linebackers:

-   Man on #2 receiver
