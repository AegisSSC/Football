Cover 3 is a zone [[Defensive Coverage]]with corners and safeties protecting the deep thirds of the field. Each sideline is covered by the corners and the middle of the field by the safety. That leaves four defenders to cover the underneath zones. Cover 3 allows the defense to keep defenders in the box for the run game while continuing to cover deep and prevent the big play.



## Cover 3 Philosophy

[[Base Cover 3]] balances pass coverage with run defense. The extra safety in the box helps protect against the run and the zone coverage underneath can transfer crossers that would cause issues for [man coverages](https://weeklyspiral.com/2021/07/12/cover-1/). Some teams will also play press Cover 3 outside to prevent easy access throws that would come with off coverage. The Seahawks were famous in the 2010s for their [physical style of press bail Cover 3](https://www.nbcsports.com/northwest/seattle-seahawks/seahawks-legion-boom-decade-suffocating-opposing-offenses).

While Cover 3 keeps an additional player to help against the run, there are still only four underneath zone defenders and offenses will often try to stress the amount of field that those those players have to cover.


## Cover 3 Assignments

Most defenses at the NFL and college levels play match coverage in Cover 3 which institutes man coverage principles when receivers run deep.

#### Corners:

-   No run responsibility
-   If #1 runs a route deeper than 10 yards, cover that receiver in man
-   If #1 runs shorter than 10 yards or runs across, get eyes to #2 and collect if they enter the deep third

#### Free Safety:

-   No run responsibility
-   Pedal and split vertical routes

#### Nickel / Outside Linebackers:

-   Outside gap run contain
-   Hands on #2 and funnel inside
-   Sink to a depth of 10-12 yards to the top of the numbers and close the window in the curl zone before pursuing routes to the flats
    -   The curl / flat defenders must first buzz through the curl zone and take away the throwing window on their way to the flat
        -   However, they must not be out-leveraged to the flat in the process

#### Middle Linebackers:

-   Inside gap run support
-   Carry seams vertical to 10-12 yards to help the safety
-   Wall crossers
-   Sink and collect routes in middle hook zone

## Cover 3 Variations

#### Buzz

In Cover 3 Buzz, the defense is disguising Cover 3 as a two-deep safety look. Buzz is very similar to [Cover 1 Robber](https://weeklyspiral.com/2021/07/12/cover-1/), with the strong safety coming down to the middle hook zone and the linebacker bumping out to the curl / flat. All other assignments stay the same for the defense. Buzz just has one safety dropping from depth to attack the middle hook zone and confuse the offense into making a poor decision.
