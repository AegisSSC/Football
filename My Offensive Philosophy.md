My Offensive Philosophy, is a synthesis of what I currently have stored within my vault to coordinate how, if in charge of an offense, how it would operate. 


In Conjunction with [[My Defensive Philosophy]] It would form the foundation of how schematically I would run my football team.




## General Offensive Style


"Defining my Offensive Philosophy" - Power Run + Vertical Passing
Combining Air Raid Passing concepts with Power Run to create Power Raid offense. 
Utilizing Power Running Concepts with Vertical Passing Concepts to balance out the disadvantages of both affectionately named Power Raid. 

"Feed them Crack and Let 'em eat'"
	The goal is to simplify the rules of engagement while applying pressure up the middle and capitalizing on 1 on 1 opportunities in which we leverage size, and physicality to win vertically while winning with speed horizontally.

- 60-40 Pass to Run Ratio. 
- 2 to 3 Foot Splits between Offensive Linemen to give a better balance between Power and Air Raid
- Using this hybrid approach, it keeps defenses honest because they have to respect both attacks
- Has the Ability to use Passing and Rushing Attack to open up opportunities for the other. 
- Any Quick Pass can be paired with any Rush to Create an RPO opportunity
- Any Run can be paired with any Quick Pass to Create an RPO opportunity


## How its built
Our Offense will be structured from the trenches outward. Consistent and high level of play is the standard and nothing short will be tolerated. 


## Offensive Line:

### Left Tackle:
Strong and Long is the name of the game. A mountain of a man with the discipline to know how to diagnose and counter pass rush

### Left Guard: 
Physical Attributes:
	Physically will need to take on a number of different blockers as his role will be used in pulling and in trap plays. Most of the time in pass protection

Run Block:
	Will need to be nimble on his feet to get out in front of a running back and take on the first layer of blockers. Strong and powerful with a motor, seals off defenders with discipline.  
Pass Protection:
	Will need to be skilled and strong enough to hold up in 1 on 1 pass protection. Will work to double team with the Left Tackle before working back to the center to help with a double team. 


### Center: Athletic
Physical Attributes:	
	Someone who is a leader of his unit and the captain of the Offensive Line. Needs to be smart as he will be in charge of pass protection adjustments at the line. 
Run Block:
	In Run Blocking, he will be responsible for setting the first edge of the play. On occasion he will be asked to pull and be a lead blocker, but his primary responsibility is to give chip blocks to allow for the guards to get free to move. 

Pass Protection:
	Needs to hold up the front of the pocket in pass protection with an anchor. Will first check left for stunts and defensive games before working back to the right side to help the right guard. 

### Right Guard: 
	While the physical attributes (Height, Weight, Arm Length) are not as demanding, he will still need to be a craftsman with his hand placement. Most of their pass blocking assignments will have the center look to chip to their side first, they will still need to handle one-on-one blocking assignments, or double team this way as they will be able to make up for the slower right hand of the center. 

Against 0-T:
	In the instance where there is a 0-T is playing true to his assignment (directly over the center) the guard to the Center's Playside hand will be responsible for  Chipping and/or Double Teaming the 0-T in pass protection.

Against 1-T:
	A 1-T will be playing on the inside shoulder of the guard, or to the outside shoulder of the Center, directly lined up in the A Gap. As such, they will be responsible for double teaming the 1-T with the Center until either they or the Center hands off the block and climbs to the next level. During Passing downs, it is acceptable to continue the combo block, but not always needed. 

	In the instance where there is a Cocked Nose (affectionately called a 1.5-T), the Guard is to absolutely pancake that fucker. 

Against 2-T:
	Since the 2-T is much less common than the 1-T and 3-T, the guard will still be solely responsible for handling a 2-T in pass coverage. 
	
Against 3-T:
	The 3 Technique player will be playing on the outside shoulder of the Guard or the B Gap. Most Defenses will utilize the 3-T, they will be responsible in most situations to be take on a 3-T by themselves or with a chip with the Right Tackle. 


### Right Tackle:
Physical Attributes:	
	Someone who is a leader of his unit and the captain of the Offensive Line. Needs to be smart as he will be in charge of pass protection adjustments at the line. 
Run Block:
	In Run Blocking, he will be responsible for setting the edge of  running plays to the right. On running plays to the left, he will need to crash down and seal off the backside of the plays. 

Pass Protection:
	Stay disciplined and give and take what the defender uses. Use skill and technique to overcome discrepancies in athleticism. 

## Backfield 

### Quarterback:
Physical Attributes:


### Running back
Physical Attributes:

Pass Protection:

### Fullback
Physical Attributes:

Run Block:

Pass Protection:



## Pass Catchers:

As a general rule, we value physicality and size. On Wide Field runs, we expect our receivers to operate as an extension of our run game and will hold a Receiver's blocking ability in as much regard as their ability to receive.

### Boundary Receiver:
Physical Attributes: DK Metcalf 'Gym and Juice'
Large framed receiver with the willingness to engage with a Corner while also utilizing speed and strength to win contested catches. Emphasis on physical traits that gives flexibility within the rest of the receiver group. While they may not get as many targets as other receivers, they are the homerun hitter and are expected to maximize every chance they are given to hit pay dirt. Bigger hands are nice to have, but if they're a "hands" catcher where they can reach out and pluck the ball out of the air is more important than just having big hands. Its about making the most out of the size and speed they are gifted with and being able to reliably win at the high point. Vertical Jumping ability is less important for actual verticality and more so to demonstrate explosiveness similarly to the long jump. 

Non-Visible Attributes:


Run Block:
	Give 'em the clamps. Use that big body and hands to maximize bullying the corner/safety. 
	In instances where we utilize the Boundary Receiver in the run fit will be in situations where they are either Lead Blocking in which they will be "boxing out" the Boundary to create a line between them and the line, or as a lead blocker in run fits where the boundary is attached to the primary formation and they are to engage the safety after chipping the Edge player for the pulling linemen. 


### Field Receiver:
Physical Attributes:
Large framed receiver with the willingness to engage with a Corner while also utilizing speed and strength to win contested catches. Emphasis on physical traits that gives flexibility within the rest of the receiver group. While they may not get as many targets as other receivers, they are the homerun hitter and are expected to maximize every chance they are given to hit pay dirt. Bigger hands are nice to have, but if they're a "hands" catcher where they can reach out and pluck the ball out of the air is more important than just having big hands. Its about making the most out of the size and speed they are gifted with and being able to reliably win at the high point. Vertical Jumping ability is less important for actual verticality and more so to demonstrate explosiveness similarly to the long jump. The only difference in our system between a Field and Boundary Receiver is that a Field Receiver lines up on the wide side of the Field and have a more open route tree. There is no 1/2 split they both need to be talented. 


Non-Visible Attributes:


Run Block:
	They will not be asked to have an immediate "run blocking assignment", but they will be expected to hold up in blocking their immediate counterpart to open up a lane either to the field side sideline, or a running lane between them and the formation.

### Slot Receiver:
Physical Attributes:

Non-Visible Attributes:

Run Block:
In instances where we utilize the Slot Receiver in the run fit will be in situations where they are paired with a Tight End in which the Slot is responsible for chipping the defender before slipping off to the assist the pulling linemen. In the case where the Tight End is the pulling linemen, they will then become a free lead blocker and will engage as defense presents. It will not be asked of them often since utilizing a Fullback, Tight End, or Boundary Receiver is more favorable, but will still be stressed to the receiver. 


### Tight End:

Physical Attributes:
Bully in Run blocking, and a security blanket for quarterbacks as a possible hot read or 3rd read on most passing plays. 

Non-Visible Attributes:


Run Block:


Pass Protection:
	Most Pass Protection duties will come from either Chipping and then a delay into a route. This is especially helpful on 9s and Tackles in situations where they need further assistance securing a block in difficult matchups. 



## Run Game

The Run Game is going to predominantly derive itself from leverages and where we have advantages. Each Dedicated run play will be paired with another "counter" play to swap the direction of the run.  The direction of the play (and the call) will then come from the Quarterback determining which direction the advantage will be. 

## <u>Run Types: </u>


https://www.milehighreport.com/22451001/difference-between-zone-and-gap-scheme


### Gap Runs
	A gap scheme is built around the principle that linemen will block down to use their leverage on a defender. On the vast majority of gap concepts, there's a pulling guard creating a numbers advantage. On these concepts, the playside offensive linemen block down the line of scrimmage, making it look as though they're blocking away from the gap where the ball carrier is running. This will leave a defender unaccounted for who is blocked by the puller from the backside. The goal is to create a hole between the puller and down blocks. 
	Gap Runs are a type of running plays in which the blocker and running back is attacking a specific Gap as defined by defensive schemes. (Attacking either "A" Gap, "B" Gap, "C" Gap, or "D" Gap). As a general rule of thumb, Gap Runs can be used to set up Play Action as the Gap Run will allow for as many blockers to stay in for pass protection, while also allowing the most flexibility within route combinations. 

### Power Runs
	In Power Run, the frontside blockers to the center will block a gap down while the backside guard will pull and work towards the unblocked end man on the line of scrimmage. The backside tackle will hinge block in order to protect the space vacated by the pulling guard. 

	Power Runs are defined by pulling either a guard, or a tackle from the non-play side of the formation to the play-side of the formation to  act as another lead blocker for the runner. As such, if the guard pulls, the tackle will have to block downward to crash the defender in the "B" Gap towards the center, and if the tackle pulls, the tight end will have to crash the "C" Gap into the Guard. Typically accompanied with a Fullback to provide 2 Lead Blockers for 1 runner to open the lane up in front of them. 

### Zone Runs
	Zone blocking is built upon the idea that every offensive lineman is responsible for an area rather than an individual defender. If the lineman is covered, or a defender is lined up in their area, the blocker will step towards the playside and block that defender. If a lineman is not covered, or there isn't a defender in his area of responsibility, then the blocker will step towards the play and work to create a double team on the first defender they come into contact with along the line of scrimmage. Once this defender is controlled, one of the two blockers will climb to the second level. 
	
	Zone Runs are defined by attacking either the inside or outside of a specific direction in which you are searching for a specific cutback lane. Typically, this will require a reach block either by a center or a guard in order to create a cutback lane for the runner to find and step into. Typically this type of running play can be used to set up play action and RPO plays as the foundation of both, come from a Zone Run play. 

### 2RO Games
	2RO Games are defined as a pair of plays that are meshed together that requires the quaterback to track the box count and then find the hole in the run fit in an option play. Typically this will take the form of a Power to one side and then a Read Option or Trap going the other way.  

### Audible Run Games

# <u>Pass Game </u>
The Pass game is based around the use of quick passes where high leverage is given to the matchup.  Leverage can be defined as the advantage either in positioning compared to the quarterback that a Receiver will have against the closest defender to him. 

	In general, the numbering system is to let the Quarterback know what depth and where his first read is. The naming system would then include the primary pass concepts as groupings (i.e 11 Slant) to inform the X that he is running a Slant and that he should be expecting the ball almost immediately. In situations where the passing concept involves several recievers, they will have an entire passing concept inplace of the single word (i.e 53 Dig Smash) in which the boundary reciever will run the Dig while the Field and Slot Recievers will run a Smash Concept to the Field. 


Short Routes will be synchronized to the 3rd and 5th drop of the quarterback
### Short Routes
	As a general rule, the reciever is expected to stem off their route and turn to look for the ball on the quarterback's 3rd step for in breaking routes. This is aligned to get the ball into their hands as quick as possible while linebackers are in rotation, or before they're able to drop back from a firezone. Most of the time, the quarterback will be focused on the first read or the hot route before continuing progression. 

	On the otherhand, the receiver is expexted to stem off their route and look for the ball on the quarterback's 5th step for out breaking routes. This is to allowed to give the receiver a better chance of gaining leverage on outbreaking routes. In general, on outbreaking routes where: Against Buzz, they can gain significant leverage above them; Against Press Man, they have more room to generate space; Against Flats, they are able to find the soft spot in the zone to settle into. Most of the time, the quarterback will only read the first and second reads, or the hot route before continuing progression.

	In general, Short Routes will either start with a 30's or 50's that correspond to the depth of drop to the first read. (30 corresponds to a 3 step drop. 50 corresponds to a 5 step drop). Note that 10s and 20s are almost exclusively used for dedicated RPO's as the coupled short route to pair with a run concept. 


| Route | Steps in Drop | First Read | Hot Read |
| ----- | ------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| 11    | 1             | X          |          |
| 12    | 1             | Z          |          |
| 13    | 1             | Y          |          |
| 14    | 1             | H          |          |
| 21    | 2             | X          |          |
| 22    | 2             | Z          |          |
| 23    | 2             | Y          |          |
| 24    | 2             | H          | Y        |
| 31    | 3             | X          | H        |
| 32    | 3             | Z          | H        |
| 33    | 3             | Y          | H        |
| 34    | 3             | H          | Y        |
| 41    | 3             | X          | H        |
| 42    | 3             | Z          | H        |
| 43    | 3             | Y          | H        |
| 44    | 3             | H          | H        |




Medium Routes will be synchronized to the 5th and 7th step of the quarterback
### Medium Routes

	As a rule of the offense, the receiver is expexted to stem off their route and turn to look for the ball on the quarterback's 5th step for in breaking routes at medium depths. The 5th Step is reserved for second reads. 

	As a rule of the offense, the receiver is expected to stem off their route and turn to look for the ball on the quarterback's 7th step for out breaking routes or bootleg plays. On out breaking routes, the 7th step is used to allow for more time to give more time to gain depth while also allowing the quaterback more time to read the field, the 7th step is reserved for second reads and is classified as the end of the step system for Quick Passing schemes. At this point, the quarterback should either have found a route to pass to, or should prepare to scramble.  

| Route | Steps in Drop | First Read | Hot Read |
| ----- | ------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| 51    | 5             | X          | H        |
| 52    | 5             | Z          | H        |
| 53    | 5             | Y          | H        |
| 54    | 5             | H          | Y        |
| 61    | 5             | X          | H        |
| 62    | 5             | Z          | H        |
| 63    | 5             | Y          | H        |
| 64    | 5             | H          | H        |

Long Routes will not be synchronized to a step, but rather to a timing.
### Long Routes

	As a rule of the offense, the reciever has a fixed amount of time to stem off their route. In general, most long developing routes are paired with a congruent short breaking route to give a 2-level read for the quarterback. This is meant to force defenders into conflict on who to cover as both players are overflowing into the same area of the field. 

| Route | Steps in Drop | First Read | Hot Read |
| ----- | ------------- | ---------- | -------- |
| 71    | 7             | X          | H        |
| 72    | 7             | Z          | H        |
| 73    | 7             | Y          | H        |
| 74    | 7             | H          | Y        |
| 81    | 7             | X          | H        |
| 82    | 7             | Z          | H        |
| 83    | 7             | Y          | H        |
| 84    | 7             | H          | H        |
| 91    | 9             | X          | H        |
| 92    | 9             | Z          | H        |
| 93    | 9             | Y          | H        |
| 94    | 9             | H          | Y        |


### RPO Games
	RPO or Run Pass Option Games, are a subset of plays that combine a run and a quick pass together and rely on the quarterback to make a read on a conflict player to determine if they should keep the ball, hand it off, or pass to a receiver. In general, we will rarely call an RPO directly, we allow our Quarterback to utilize RPOs as a problem solving tool. RPOs also serve as an extension of our run game after finding the conflict player creeping up to stop the run. 

	Since all of our RPOs are built from a Run and Quick Pass Combination, it can be used as an audible to ensure the best possible solution for the Quarterback to use. 


### Play Action Games
	Play Action Games are a subset of plays that combine a fake run combined with a passing play. The purpose is to bait the defense into stopping the run play when actually stepping back to pass the ball. In general, we will use Play Action Games sparingly as an extension of our run game as a method of slowing down the pass rush while also pushing the ball downfield.
