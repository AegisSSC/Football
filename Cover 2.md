Cover 2 is a [[Defensive Coverage]] scheme in which there are two Safeties that are 12 or more yards off the Line of Scrimmage


Cover 2 is a zone coverage with two deep safeties protecting the deep halves of the field. The rest of the defense is responsible for five underneath zones. Cover 2 takes away deep routes down the sideline, but can be vulnerable down the middle of the field and in the run game.

## Cover 2 Philosophy

Cover 2 relies on athletic underneath defenders that understand their assignments and vulnerabilities of the coverage. Zones are not static and receivers must be carried and passed off to the deep defenders. Without re-routing and carrying routes underneath, the safeties have too much field to cover and can be attacked downfield.

In a pure zone Cover 2, the defense all has their eyes on the quarterback and can jump routes and make plays on the ball unlike inÂ [man coverage](https://weeklyspiral.com/2021/07/12/cover-1/). That prevents offenses from hitting quick passes underneath while still giving the defense deep help to stop the vertical pass.

## Cover 2 Assignments

#### Corners:

-   Outside or head-up alignment on #1
-   Outside gap run contain
-   Hands on #1 receiver, funneling them inside towards help
-   Sink and collect any routes that enter the flats outside with eyes in backfield
    -   Must first carry any vertical routes like a fade or corner before reacting to the flats

#### Safeties:

-   Teams align at different depths based on down and distance, level of competition, and athletic ability, but the range is from 12-18 yards
-   Some teams prefer to give their safeties no run responsibility, but others assign the alley to the safeties in run support
    -   The alley is the area between the corners and the end of the offensive formation
-   Pedal and split the difference between any two vertical routes while protecting their deep half
-   Stay as deep as the deepest route

#### Nickel / Outside Linebackers:

-   Inside gap run support
-   Hands on #2, funneling them outside
-   Sink and collect routes in the seam and hook zone at a depth of 10-12 yards between the numbers and the hash
-   Carry vertical routes and routes attacking the middle of the field before reacting to throws underneath

#### Middle Linebacker:

-   Inside gap run support
-   Head on a swivel looking to wall crossers
-   Sink and collect routes coming across the middle with eyes in the backfield
