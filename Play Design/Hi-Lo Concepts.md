Written by [[Matt Bowen]], this article covers the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] route scheme from [[Andy Reid]]'s tenure during the early 2000s. 


Inside breaking routes that test the leverage of man coverage and the techniquie of zone based defenses. Today, I want to look at 3 of them: Hi-Lo Crossers, Hi-Lo Opposite and Hi-Lo Triple-In Flood. 


# Hi-Lo Crossers

This particular coverage is based out of [[Ace]] Personnel (2 WR, 2 TE, 1 RB) in a 2x2 formation with an attached Y and X aligned off the ball on the numbers. Adding the Crossers tag gets both TEs running underneath with the Z Receiver running the intermediate dig route to create a 3 level concept inside. 

An ideal scheme to run vs. man coverage (think Cover 1 with FS in the middle of the field). Defenders aligned with outside leverage playing a route concept that breaks back to the middle of the field. It can cause natural pick situations and it allows the QB to throw to a receiver with the defender now in a trail position. A tough matchup in 3rd and medium situations and inside of the red zone.


# Hi-Lo Opposite

Hi-Lo Opposite is based from Posse personnel (3 WR, 1 TE, 1 RB) in a base Doubles alignment. This concept is to attack the middle of the defense between the numbers. By using the Opposite tag, the Hi-Lo comes from the opposing sides of the formation with a Slot receiver running a Drag and the TE running a Dig. The Z and X are running clear out routes to create as much space in the middle of the defense as possible. 

This concept tests man coverae and can be modified to beat Zone by having the Slot receiver sitting down in the underneath holes. The TE can press the Strong Safety in Cover 4. 


# Hi-Lo Triple-In Flood

This route distribution comes out of Regular personnel (2 WR, 1 TE, 2 RB) has the Z motion from outside the numbers to a close bunch with the TE. The FLEX will run a Spot Route, the Z runs a Drag Route, and the TE will run a Dig route with a RB Screen Route as the HOT Read. 

Anytime you are playing a bunch formation, you have to be technique sound as a defense—in both zone and man coverage. Routes have to passed off in Cover 1 (play four on three or “Box” technique) and you can’t chase a receiver in zone coverage. The problem here is the RB (R) releasing on a the swing route. He has to be accounted for and when QB Michael Vick can flip the ball out to LeSean McCoy, one missed tackle and we are looking at an explosive play up the field. Bottom line, this route scheme can be a major issue to any defense and it will translate into points in the red zone if it isn’t played properly.
