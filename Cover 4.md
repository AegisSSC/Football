Cover 4 is a [[Defensive Coverage]] scheme in which the defense is segmented into quarters width wise for duties. 

Cover 4 uses four deep defenders and three defenders underneath. Typically, Cover 4 uses [match principles](https://www.patspulpit.com/2019/3/4/18234062/film-room-pattern-match-zone-rip-liz-cover-3-match-mable-nick-saban-cleveland-browns) which involves man-coverage techniques while running zone. The goal of the coverage is to prevent the deep ball while still having safeties close enough to the line of scrimmage to contribute in the run game and help to bracket receivers.

## Cover 4 Philosophy

Cover 4 blends man coverage principles into zone coverage. Defenses will typically play their safeties closer to the line of scrimmage at 10-14 yards. That’s because those safeties have to be able to contribute in the run game and help with the alley or outside run gaps. As a result, the coverage is heavily reliant on safeties that can make quick decisions, cover ground, and are also solid tacklers.


## Cover 4 Assignments

#### Corners:
-   No run responsibility
-   If #1 goes vertical further than 10 yards in your zone, match in man coverage
-   If #1 goes short or inside, get eyes on #2

#### Safeties:
-   Outside gap run contain
-   If #2 goes vertical further than 10 yards in your zone, match in man coverage
-   If #2 goes short or to the flats, get eyes on #1

#### Nickel / Outside Linebackers:
-   Inside gap run support
-   Hands on #2 funneling them outside
-   Sink and pursue to flat

#### Middle Linebackers:
-   Inside gap run support
-   Wall crossers
-   Sink and collect vertical threats down the middle or get under deep crossers
