Clemson is one of the founding members of the ACC and holds 20 ACC titles, the most of any member. Its 26 total conference titles, including six consecutive ACC titles from 2015 to 2020, are the most of any ACC school.

Among its eight undefeated regular seasons, Clemson was crowned poll-era national champions and finished with its third perfect season with a win over Nebraska in the [1982 Orange Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_Orange_Bowl "1982 Orange Bowl"), and was the [National Championship Finalist Runner-up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_College_Football_Playoff_National_Championship "2016 College Football Playoff National Championship") with a 14–1 record in 2015. The following season, Clemson won the National Title over No. 1 Alabama in college football's first [National Championship rematch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_College_Football_Playoff_National_Championship "2017 College Football Playoff National Championship") in 2016, and again in 2018. The Tigers have 46 bowl appearances, 20 of which are among the [New Year's Six](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year%27s_Six "New Year's Six") Bowls, including nine during the "Big Four" era.
