# <u>Michigan State University</u>

The **Michigan State Spartans football** program (MSU) represents [Michigan State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_University "Michigan State University") in [college football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football "College football") at the [NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_I_(NCAA) "Division I (NCAA)") ([[NCAAF]]) level. The Spartans are members of the #Big_10_Conference  Michigan State claims a total of six [national championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"). The Spartans have also won eleven conference championships, with two in [Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Intercollegiate_Athletic_Association "Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association") and nine in the Big Ten.

Home games of the Spartans are played at [Spartan Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartan_Stadium,_East_Lansing "Spartan Stadium, East Lansing"), which is located on the main university campus. Spartan Stadium is consistently ranked among the NCAA's Top 25 in attendance. The Spartans are led by head coach [Mel Tucker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Tucker "Mel Tucker").



When [[Nick Saban]] arrived in [East Lansing, Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Lansing,_Michigan "East Lansing, Michigan"), prior to the 1995 season, MSU had not had a winning season since 1990, and the team was sanctioned by the NCAA for recruiting violations committed under his predecessor and former mentor, [George Perles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Perles "George Perles")

-   **1995–1997** – Beginning in 1995, Saban moderately improved MSU's fortunes, taking the Spartans to minor bowl games (all of which they lost by double-digit margins) in each of his first three seasons. From 1995 to 1997, Michigan State finished 6-5-1, 6–6, and 7–5. In comparison, MSU had finished 5–6, 6–6 and 5–6 (prior to NCAA forfeits) in 1992–1994.
-   **1998** – On November 7, 1998, the Spartans upset the No. 1 ranked [Ohio State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football "Ohio State Buckeyes football") 28–24 at [Ohio Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Stadium "Ohio Stadium"). However, even after the upset and an early-season rout of then-highly ranked Notre Dame the Spartans finished 6–6, including three last-minute losses featuring turnovers, defensive lapses, and special-teams misplays, and failed to earn a bowl invitation.
-   **1999** – Saban led the Spartans to a 9–2 season that included wins over [Notre Dame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish "Notre Dame Fighting Irish"), [Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines_football "Michigan Wolverines football"), [Ohio State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football "Ohio State Buckeyes football"), and [Penn State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_State_Nittany_Lions_football "Penn State Nittany Lions football"). Conversely, the two losses were routs at the hands of [Purdue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_Boilermakers_football "Purdue Boilermakers football") and [Wisconsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_Badgers_football "Wisconsin Badgers football"). Following the final regular-season game against Penn State, Saban abruptly resigned to accept the head coaching position with Louisiana State University. Saban's assistant head coach and successor, [Bobby Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Williams "Bobby Williams"), then coached MSU to a [Citrus Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Citrus_Bowl "Florida Citrus Bowl") victory over University of Florida, giving the Spartans an overall record of 10–2 for the 1999 season. It would be the best season in terms of wins for the Spartans since 1965, and it would see the Spartans reach their highest ranking since the 1966 team. Future former NFL Head Coach [Josh McDaniels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_McDaniels "Josh McDaniels") served as a graduate assistant on Saban's 1999 coaching staff.

Saban never won a bowl game in his tenure at Michigan State, going 0–3 and losing those bowl contests by a combined 85 points.
