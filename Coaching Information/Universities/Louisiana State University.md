### Nick Saban era (2000–2004)


On December 1, 1999, LSU hired Michigan State head coach [[Nick Saban]] as DiNardo's replacement. In Saban's first season of 2000, LSU returned to national prominence by beating No. 11 Tennessee in overtime 38–31 on ESPN, after which the goal posts were torn down for only the 2nd time in the history of Tiger Stadium. The victory over Tennessee also marked the first time that LSU played in an overtime game at home. Just a few weeks later, the goal posts were again ripped down as LSU beat Alabama 30–28 on CBS in Baton Rouge for the first time in 31 years. This was the 3rd and final time that the goal posts came down in Death Valley.

In 2001], No. 21 LSU staged an upset victory over No. 2 Tennessee] in the SEC Championship, winning 31–20. The victory earned LSU a spot in its first Sugar Bowl since 1986, and knocked the Volunteers out of national title contention. No. 16 LSU survived an upset bid from unranked Kentucky in 2002 by winning the game 33–30 on a miraculous 75-yard Hail Mary pass as time expired known as the "Bluegrass Miracle". Kentucky coach [Guy Morriss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Morriss "Guy Morriss") had received the traditional [Gatorade bath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatorade_bath "Gatorade bath") right before the Hail Mary. Kentucky fans, believing they had won, had already rushed the field and torn down one goal post.

In [2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_LSU_Tigers_football_team "2003 LSU Tigers football team"), No. 11 LSU outlasted No. 7 Georgia, 17–10. With ESPN College Gameday on hand for the first time since 1997, Quarterback [Matt Mauck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mauck "Matt Mauck") found wide receiver [Skyler Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyler_Green "Skyler Green") for a 34-yard touchdown with 3:03 remaining in the game. All-American cornerback [Corey Webster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Webster "Corey Webster") sealed the victory with an interception in the final minute. The contest dubbed the "Let the Valley Shake" Game is notable for LSU fans chanting LSU-LSU after a Georgia touchdown. Georgia head coach [Mark Richt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Richt "Mark Richt") was quoted as saying, "Usually when the opposing team does well, the crowd quiets down. All I began to hear was a chant, 'L-S-U, L-S-U.' It got louder and louder and louder. It was the loudest I've ever heard a stadium." The win catapulted LSU onto the national scene. LSU won its second title and became the BCS national champion by defeating [Oklahoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_Sooners_football "Oklahoma Sooners football") 21–14 in the [2004 Sugar Bowl (BCS National Championship Game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Sugar_Bowl "2004 Sugar Bowl").
