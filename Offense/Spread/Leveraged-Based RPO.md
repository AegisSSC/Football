## Leveraged-Based RPOs
These are plays that involve a pre-snap decision by the quarterback solely based on the leverage of the conflict defender in relation to the route that we have tagged to our run. The decision is simple. We try to decrease the amount of gray area in making the decision by defining what leverage means: width and depth. Prior to snapping the ball, the quarterback would determine if the receiver will have width advantage against the conflict player. If he does, he will throw for his receiver, if the receiver does not have advantage, he will execute the run.

## Width Advantage:
Width Advantage can be defined as simply asking if the receiver is closer to his destination than the player who is assigned to him. For out breaking routes, we determine advantage by which ever player is closer to the sideline meaning that if the coverage player has inside leverage, the receiver has the Width advantage to the outside. For in breaking routes, we determine advantage by whichever player is closer to the quarterback meaning that if the coverage player has outside leverage, then the receiver has Width Advantage to the inside. The only scenario in which it becomes complicated is when the coverage player is directly stacked over the intended receiver. At this point, we then need to determine if we have any other advantage.

## Depth Advantage:
Depth Advantage is defined by the amount of vertical space the coverage player has on the intended receiver. In particular, since most RPOs are relatively short passes, it is possible to take advantage of any depth that a coverage player may give to a receiver. The general rule of thumb for depth advantage is 8 to 10 yards off of the receiver, or if the coverage player is on the partial level between the linebacker depth and the safety's depth.

## Forced Advantage:
As another type of advantage, Forced Advantage is defined by the use of a 2 on 1 situation in which the non intended receiver rubs the intended receiver's coverage player with a force move. This could either be a Jam block, or a pointed route towards the coverage player. This is typically only seen after the snap when the corner covering the unintended receiver pedals back into a cover 3 look. In this instance the unintended receiver will wall off the coverage player and create an alley for the targeted receiver to take on the off coverage corner 1 on 1 to the boundary.
