## Numbers-Based RPO
These are plays that involve a pre-snap decision by the quarterback based on the total number of defenders that are inside of the Tackle-Box to defend the run. The quarterback will count the total number of defenders and determine if the RPO can handle that many defenders. 

If there are more defenders in the Tackle-Box than the RPO is designed to handle, then the ball must be thrown. Because of the extra man inside of the Tackle-Box, most of the time, the receivers will be in one-on-one coverage, and so, routes that can give a receiver an advantage in this situation are typically packaged with Numbers-Based RPOs.
