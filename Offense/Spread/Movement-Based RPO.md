## Movement-Based RPOs

These are a suborder of RPOs that involve a post-snap decision by the quarterback based on the movement of a conflict defender relative to the route that our intended receiver will run. 

The rules for Movement-Based RPOs are simplified to a second or third level conflict player. The quarterback will read the movement of the conflict player, if he moves in the direction of the run play, the quarterback will pull the ball and throw it to the receiver, if the conflict defender stays put, or moves towards the receiver, then the ball will be handed off for the run play.
