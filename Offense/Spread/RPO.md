RPOs or Run-Pass Options are a subset of plays that are designed to have a run and pass option built into the play.

In general, it is an extension of the [[Spread]] Offense in which it allows the Quarterback to read how the defense is responding. In general, the strategy was to find the best player on the defense and put him in conflict where his decision would always be wrong. 


In the beginning, the first derivation was a result of the inside zone option (aka the Inside Zone Read) in which the Quarterback would key off either the Linebacker or the Defensive End to either hand off the ball, or they would keep it.  In spread systems, this resulted in more production, but also more hits and injury concerns from Quarterbacks. 

The first version of  RPO play calls evolved as a solution to reducing the overall hits to a Quarterback in the inside zone option. It accomplished this by incorporating a screen as apart of the play call giving the quarterback another option. As such, the read process became

Read the Defensive Lineman for Inside Zone
Read the Overhang Defender for the Screen

This would allow an evolved version of the Triple Option to be adapted into the Spread Scheme and make it harder for defenders to cover every possibility. This later is reclassified into what former [[University of Miami]] head coach [[Mark Richt]] referred to as [[Leveraged-Based RPO]]s. 

As an extension of Leveraged-Based RPOs, [[Marshall University]] developed the [[Movement-Based RPO]]s. However, unlike their counterparts, these are based solely on the post-snap read of the quarterback. 

The last type of RPO, which may be the most simple, was a development originally from Clemson University's Offensive Coordinator [[Chad Morris]]. This type of RPO was known as the [[Numbers-Based RPO]] or Box-Count RPO.
