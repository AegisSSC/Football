This article comes primarily from the Bobby Peters "The 2022 Jacksonville Jaguars Complete Offensive Manual" and the teachings from this will go on to expand the concepts used during Year 2 of Trevor Lawrence. 




# Introduction
Doug Pederson was back at it in 2022 after taking a year off coaching. He brough his playbook over from Philadelphia, after giving it a nice overhaul in his sabbatical. Many staple concepts were recognizable from his time in Philly, but Pederson and his coaching staff evolved the system and made sure to adjust to their personnel. 

Pederson's success in Philadelphia was in large part due to his use of RPO's. The same can be said for Jacksonville. Pederson will pair various pass concepts with both inside and outside zone as the primary run concepts. 

The 2022 Jaguars are a good case study in year 1 of a new team, new system, and new quarterback. For all intents and purposes, this was essentially a rookie season for Trevor Lawrence as well. Installing and game planning concepts that fit Lawrence's skillset while growing him as a professional quarterback were of paramount importance for the coaching staff. 

When I reference any coverage, especially cover 4 and cover 2, I am using these label as catch- all for the different calls and checks associated with zone-match coverage (and even man-match). They also cover the spot-drop distinctions as well. 


## Definitions:

Fast Motion:
	Full speed motion at the snap of the ball.
Simulated Pressure:
	In simplest terms, the defense still only rushes four, but they will bring at least one non-traditional rusher and drop a traditional rusher into the coverage.
Cluster:
	A loose bunch. The Dolphins used Cluster formations often. They allow the offense to cross receivers, without the defense alerting to their bunch checks as frequently. 
Bang Dig:
	This is the term I use to describe the glance-type route. In between a post and a dig, usually cut at about 7 steps. The route looks to replace hook defenders over the middle of the field. 



## Defensive Front Glossary:

Bear: 
	Head up nose with two 3T. Part of the Odd Front Family
Over: 
	4 down with a 3T and a 1/2iT nose.
Under: 
	Even front with the Nose shaded to the strong side of the offense. Often times the defense will walk the Sam Linebacker up on the end of the line of scrimmage in this front as well. 
Wide: 
	Even front with 2 3T. 
Odd: 
	4-0-4. Head up ends on the Tackles with a head up Nose. 
6-Man:
	An even front with the Sam and Will walked up on the line of scrimmage. The interior can be some combination of one game and two gap principles. This defensive front became popularized against the Shannahan/McVay/LeFleur type of offense when the Patriots used it to stifle the Rams in the 2018 Superbowl. 
Diamond: 
	Similar structure to a bear front, but linebackers walked up into the interior gaps instead of down lineman. This is a common front to see in passing situations.
Mug: 
	An even front with the interior linebackers walked up into their gaps. This is another common front in passing situations

## Coverage Glossary:
All of the coverages should be taken with a grain of salt since coverages are often hard to determine without knowing the call. For instance, the four vertical concepts would play out similarly for a Cover 3 zone match coverage as it would for a Cover 1.

Cover 0: 
	Man Coverage with no safety help. There could still be a rat/hole player with these calls.
Cover 1: 
	Single high man coverage with a low hole/rat. Some calls have the rat/hole player double a specific receiver.
Cover 2:
	Spot drop zone and zone match cover 2 (including Tampa 2)
Cover3: 
	Single high zone/zone match coverage
Cover 4: 
	Quarters (mainly zone match)
Cover 5: 
	Man under two deep. This sections does include some of the Saban Cover 7 (man match quarters) calls that play out like man under two deep. 
Cover 42: (Cover 6) 
	Quarters to one side, cover 2 to the other. 
Drop 8 (Cover 8): 
	Eight dropped into coverage (3 man rush)
5 Man Pressure: 
	Any calls that involves five rushers. The coverage call could be any of the above-listed coverages. 


# Ground Game:
The Jaguars are an Inside Zone team. Inside Zone accounts for about 15% of their total snaps in 2022. They carry multiple versions, reads, jake jets, slices, bluffs, and RPO's with it.

## Inside Zone Weak
	This section covers basic inside zone, with one or two back side Tight Ends. The Tight End(s) is responsible for the back side defensive end. This is often the hardest block in inside zone. If you have a strong blocking tight end, these versions make a lot of sense. 
	
	If the defense rotates a safety down, the offense uses a BSWR to dig him out. This can be accomplished with condensed splits or using short motion. In spread out formations, the RPO versions make more sense to control the secondary defenders. 

### Why it Worked:
	Strong Double teams are a common theme for the 4-6 yard runs the Jaguars had in this version of inside zone. An example of Inside Zone against an Over front.

### Why it Didn't Work:
		In the week 2 3rd down clip, the Colts rotate their secondary late and stunt the front. This causes the offensive line to work to the same linebacker, which leaves a back side defender unblocked. Great scheme call from Indianapolis in a short yardage situation. 

## Inside Zone Nub
Running Inside Zone from a Nub formation allows the offense to just "call it - run it", and not necessarily need a check/alert/RPO element to alleviate a bad look. A Nub formation is one with a tight end(s) to one side, and no receivers outside of them. They are also referred to as "closed" formations. The Jaguars would occasionally read the Backside Defensive End to create zone read within this version. They would arc one or both Tight Ends. This can be seen in Week 10. 

Pederson and the Jaguars liked to call this in the low red zone. Since defenses can load the box in the low red zone,, "call it - run it" plays are a good way to get a better look to run the ball. 

### Why it Worked:
	The first week 13 clip shows a good rep of 11 personnel Inside Zone against a Bear front. The Center holds his own against the nose, not winning, but not losing. The double team on the back side 3T  gets a ton of vertical movement. Etienne does an excellent job of running behind the doulble team to hit the C-Gap. This clip is a good example of howw the run is still good agsinst single high, without needing an RPO or a check/alert.

### Why it Didn't Work:
	In week 17, Houston calls a nice stunt to get the Mike Linebacker free to make the tackle. The 4i on the back side is able to win back against the Back side Tackle, which forces the running back to work front side. The Front side Defensive End loops to the A-Gap, occupying the Play side Guard. The Center is unable to get the Mike Linebacker in time as he is working to the B-Gap.

## Inside Zone - Fake Jet Same
Running fake Jet to the same side of the Inside Zone call helps account for different secondary rotations. It is often an alert at the line of scrimmage against pre-snap weak rotation.
The Flow of the fake jet also encourages the defense to over-pursue. Inside Zone wants to cut back, so linebackers flowing harder play side helps the offensive line work up to their combinations easier. 

This version of inside zone was called most often in week 1 and week 2. The Jaguars did not run it as much as the season progressed. 
### Why it Worked:
	In the long week 1 run, Washington plays Cover 1 and run with the fake jet. The tight end wins his block. The offensive line is able to handle the movement well too.

### Why it Didn't Work:
	In week 5, the play hits front side against an Over front. The Play side Linebacker gets off the block from the Play side Guard and chases the play down quickly.

## Inside Zone - Slice
This section covers the base version of Inside Zone Slice. This concept calls for the offensive line to block inside zone, and the Tight End to "slice" across the formation to block the back side defensive end. The concept is an easy addition to the base version of inside zone, the tight end is just starting on the other side of the formation. 
The slicing action forces a response from the defense. The offense is moving a gap from one side of the ball to the other. Do the linebackers fall back a gap? Do the safeties rotate to the slicer? Does a man defender chase?

### Why it Worked:
	In General, the Jaguars were a solid split zone team in 2022. In week 2, the Jaguars converted a 3rd and 2 against a single high defense. The Mike Linebacker plays tentative with the motion and Slice action, so tthe combination block ends up taking the nickel, who knifes into the run fit. Evan Engram executes a great Slice block, and the Back side Tackle gets up to the Will Linebacker. The ball hits the back side C-Gap. 
	In Week 9, the ball hits the front side B-Gap against an Under front. The linebackers fall back a gap, and the Strong Safety is hesitant to stick his nose in an interior gap. 

### Why it Didn't Work:
	In week 16, the Jets bring a secondary blitz off the front side of the run the Play Side Wide Receiver does not have a good angle for him, and he is able to get into the backfield untouched. 

## Inside Zone Slice - Backside Tight End
This version of Inside Zone Slice is typically game planned against odd/5-down teams. The addition of the back side tight end allows the offense to create a double team on the Back side Defensive End, instead of leaving the Back side Tackle 1-on-1 with him. In this instance, the receivers are responsible for any secondary support. 

In week 1, 5, and 14, the Jaguars added a "Tackle - Over" tag. This adds another offensive lineman on the back side, instead of a tight end. The tight end not slicing will now block on the front side of the play. With inside zone usually cutting back, this gets a better blocker at the point of attack. This allows the Jaguars to keep more athletic tight ends on the field (a more pass-heavy personnel group) while also giving the defense another headache preparing during the week. 

### Why it Worked
	In week 15, the Jaguars run the concept out of a Nub alignment. Against a 6T on the back side, they elect to arch him. The slicing tight end will take the Defensive End, and the Back side Tight End arcs up for the Back side Line Backer. The Cornerback is the unblocked defender against the Cowboys single high defense. In general, a good vertical push on the combination blocks was a common theme on successful runs.

### Why it Didn't Work
	In week 2, a down safety shoots the open front side gap before the wide receiver can make the block on him. In week 3, the Chargers stunt away from the call. The 2T on the play side beats the Center away from his help and gets into the backfield. This kind of line movement can give zone runs trouble.
