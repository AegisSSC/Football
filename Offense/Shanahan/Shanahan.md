The Shanahan system is a offensive philosophy developed by [[Mike Shanahan]] and evolved further by his son [[Kyle Shanahan]]. 

Our study will begin on the 2004 [[Denver Broncos]] Offense under [[Mike Shanahan]]


A big part of the Shanahan System is the numbering system and their alignment. As such, we will first discuss this system to better understand the rest of the run scheme


### Run Scheme:
0: Right Shoulder of the Center 
2: Behind the Right Guard
4: Behind the Right Tackle
6: Behind the Tight End
8: Outside to the Right of the Tackle Box


1: Left Shoulder of the Center
3: Behind the Left Guard
5: Behind the Left Tackle
7: Outside Shoulder of the Left Tackle
9: Outside to the Left of the Tackle Box 


The Running Back would align on the inside leg of the Offensive Tackles with his heels 5 yards behind the Line of Scrimmage. 



Anatomy of a Play:
## [[Huddle]] and Play Call
From the Quarterback around clockwise:
Quarterback, Left Tackle, Left Guard, Center, Right Guard, Right Tackle, Y Receiver, Full Back, Z Receiver, X Receiver, Running Back
1. Center always sets up huddle 8 yards away from the ball quickly
2. Huddle is oval shaped with the Quarterback's Left Shoulder to the Line of Scrimmage
3. Line up quickly with hands on knees in position to see and hear the Quarterback
4. Quarterback has complete control of the huddle
5. You will receive the following information:
	1. Formation (with Motion)
	2. Play
	3. Blocking Responsibilities
	4. Pass Pattern
	5. Snap Number
6. If you do not hear what is said call "Check" 
7. "Break" is the signal to leave the huddle - clap hands - linemen turn to oustide and go to the Line of Scrimmage quickly.
8. The huddle reflects the attitude of each man and the tteam - keep it sharp, keep it clean
9. Quarterback will not call "Break" untill the receivers have left the huddle

The Following information will be given in this order:
1. Formation 
2. Formation Adjustments
3. Motions or Shifts
4. Play Number
5. Play Terms 
6. Snap Count
7. Break


Quick Count - Red
On One - White
On Two - Blue
On Three - Yellow


Offensive Accountability:

__Quarterbacks:__
1. During any non-team drill in practice, it is out expectation to not let any football hit the ground. (Strive for Perfection)
2. During any game, it is out expectation to never be charged with a Delay of Game Penalty. The Quarterback is at fault if we are. 
3. During any game it is the Quarterback's responsibility to ensure each member of the offensive unit leaves the huddle with the proper play call. 
4. During any game, it is our expectation that the Qb makes only good decisions with the football. This included, but is not limited to, never forcing throws in the red zone and never taking sacks on 3rd down that takes our offense out of [[Scoring]] Range. 
5. It is our expectation to win all the time. Havingt this expectation requires that the Quarterback be accountable above and beyond the rest of his teammates and sets the eample of how we prepare to win football games. 

__Wide Recievers:__
1. Be Physical and relentless in the run game blocking scheme. We will be committed to the run or you won't be on the field!
2. As a group, we will make plays and we will not be denied the End Zone! We are didicated to run after the catch and we will move the chains! We are responsible for making plays. 
3. When the ball is in the air, it belongs to us. If tthe ball touches your hands, it is your ball. 
4. Develop a complete understanding of your offensive playbook and the schemes as they relate to coverage. The educated student of the game can go on the field and ract while his opponent is still thinking. Always know your opponent. 
5. Prepare yourself in the weight room to dominate your opponent. Leave no stone unturned, continue to grow each year, never being satisfied with the previous year. 

__Running Backs:__
1. Finish every play full speed with or without the ball. 
2. Omit Fumbles and Protect the ball at all costs
3. Blocking is a must. Attack space and play for the team
4. No negative yards. Move the ball up field in a hurry, you only get one cut
5. Stay in bounds and take yards aggressively. 

__Tight Ends:__
1. Know your assignment on every play before you leave the huddle. There are a lot of formations, no missed assignments
2. Always finish your blocks. Frontside or Backside you are responsible for your assignments.
3. When the ball is thrown to us, we always make the play! It never touches the ground. We touch it, we catch it. 
4. Always turn the ball up in your shadow after you catch the ball. Finish past the head coach
5. Always look for yards after the catch, make plays for your team. 

__Offensive Line__:
1. Be Smart - Work for no mental mistakes in assignment and techniqure. You must be accountable for knowing whaat you are to do and how to do it. 
2. Be Tough - Play Hard, Tought, and aggressive in practice and in games. Give your coaches and teammates a great effort every play and every day. 
3. Be Consistent - Study, prepare, and work every day. You must come ready to work and improve each day, every period. As a team and as an individual. 
4. Talk - We must work as a unit. Our performance is absed on how we work as a group and we need to be on the same page every play. 
5. Listen - In order to play and improve you must be willing to do what we ask. Refining your technique and skills is essential to our success.
