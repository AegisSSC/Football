My Defensive Philosophy, is a synthesis of what I currently have stored within my vault to coordinate how, if in charge of an defense, how it would operate. 


In Conjunction with [[My Offensive Philosophy]] It would form the foundation of how schematically I would run my football team






## Defensive Line:

### Left Tackle: The Mountain
Strong and Long is the name of the game. A mountain of a man with the discipline to know how to diagnose and counter pass rush

### Left Guard: Sledgehammer 
Physical Attributes:
	Physically will need to take on a number of different blockers as his role will be used in pulling and in trap plays. Most of the time in pass protection

Run Block:
	Will need to be nimble on his feet to get out in front of a running back and take on the first layer of blockers. Strong and powerful with a motor, seals off defenders with discipline.  
Pass Protection:
	Will need to be skilled and strong enough to hold up in 1 on 1 pass protection. Will work to double team with the Left Tackle before working back to the center to help with a double team. 


### Center: Athletic Bulldozer
Physical Attributes:	
	Someone who is a leader of his unit and the captain of the Offensive Line. Needs to be smart as he will be in charge of pass protection adjustments at the line. 
Run Block:
	In Run Blocking, he will be responsible for setting the first edge of the play. On occasion he will be asked to pull and be a lead blocker, but his primary responsibility is to give chip blocks to allow for the guards to get free to move. 

Pass Protection:
	Needs to hold up the front of the pocket in pass protection with an anchor. Will first check left for stunts and defensive games before working back to the right side to help the right guard. 

### Right Guard: Skilled Craftsman
	While the physical attributes are not as demanding, he will still need to be a solid run blocker. Most of their pass blocking assignments will have the center chip, or double team this way as they will be able to make up for the slower right hand of the center. 

### Right Tackle: Master Technician
Physical Attributes:	
	Someone who is a leader of his unit and the captain of the Offensive Line. Needs to be smart as he will be in charge of pass protection adjustments at the line. 
Run Block:
	In Run Blocking, he will be responsible for setting the edge of  running plays to the right. On running plays to the left, he will need to crash down and seal off the backside of the plays. 

Pass Protection:
	Stay disciplined and give and take what the defender uses. Use skill and technique to overcome discrepancies in athleticism.
