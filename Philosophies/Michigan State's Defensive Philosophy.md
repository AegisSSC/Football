Michigan State's [Defensive Philosophy] was as follows:

- On First and Second Down, stop the tun through [[Zone Coverage]]
- On Third down, we will play [[Man Coverage]] and [[Blitz]] on 90% of 3rd down opportunites
- Defend Inside to Outside in Coverage
- Defend Inside to outside against the run
- Eliminate Deep Passes, forcing them short
- Eliminate Inside Passes, forcing them outside

The Trademark of Michigan State's Defense is Agressiveness and Physicality. 

Inside the [[Red Zone]] we will focus on eliminating the run while playing tight pass coverage Limiting teams to [[Field Goals]] and prevent [[Touchdowns]]

Defensively, will must adapt to Every Situation that presents itself and execute successsfully. This requires good communication, teamwork, and Personnel Substitutions.

Possible Situations that we will account for will be:
- [[Third Down]]
- [[Fourth Down]]
- [[Two-Minute]]
- [[Short Yardage]]
- [[Conserving Time]]
- [[Protecting a Lead]]
- [[Opponent Backed Up]]
- [[No Huddle]]

We must "Put the Fire out" and control the Momentum of the game through [[Takeaways]] and create short yardage situations for our offense. 

1. A Defense Must be a Team Effort:
	1. Prevent [[Touchdowns]] and [[Scoring]]. The effectiveness of a defensive team is measured by the number of points scored against. 
	2. Comprise of Men who knows their individual assignment and responibility on every defense and and play his own responsibility each and every play. 
	3. Comprise of men who carry out his team assignment positively to allow the team to function collectively. [[Pursuit]] and [[Gang Tackling]] are vital parts of team effort. 
	4. Not take gambles comprimising the integrity of the defense by playing individually. Every man carries out his assignment completely
	5. Keep the gain down to a minimum and prevent long run or pass plays. 
	6. Force offensive errors

2. Run Defense:
	We will create victories for our defensive by playing Great Defense versus the run. Each man must play his responsibility, pursue the ball with superhuman effort, be vicious tacklers, and keep proper leverage on the football at all times. [[Gang Tackling]] will discourage great backs and create [[Turnovers]]. 

3. Pass Defense
	1. The [[Defensive Line]] must continuously put [[Pressure]] on the passer by rushing in your own prescribed lane and by super human second effort. By staying in your proper rushing lane, you will contain the passer, thereby preventing him from [[Scrambling]] outside the [[Pocket]]. Rush is dictated by [[QB]] and [[Pass Protection]]. Stay on your feet and get hands in the QB's face
	2. Our [[Linebackers]] must hold up and force the release of the [[Offensive Tackles]] based upon the defense call, formation set, situation, and field position. Dropping to their defensive positions for pass, reroute receivers based on coverage, match the pattern and break on the ball. Get good reaction to thrown ball, and be aggresive to get the ball out with a swat or collision. [[Linebackers]] must react to call by [[Backs]], [[Cross]], [[Smash]] and other calls
	3. Our [[Defensive Backs]] must learn their responsibilites the techniques, and carry out their responsibilities. The secret of covering a receiver is good technique, vision, knowing where the reception area is, reaction to the ball, poise, and toughness
4. Desire to do the Job -- Desire to Study the Game will Improve your Game
	1. Know how our defensive design will stop our opponent's tendencies
	2. Tackling. You must have the desire to "Be a Hitter", concentrate on your Target, and drive through their soft spot with a rising blow
	3. Rushing the passer [[Defensive Line]] and[[ Linebackers]]. Technique and desire to get to the [[Quarterback]] at all costs. Don't be hesitant. It must be an all-out thing. 
	4. Pay the price to be a winner. Desire here is the most important aspect of winning. Each and every defensive player must have the pride and personalambition to be a winner. You must "Pay the Price" with Extra work, Study, and Conditioning to be a winner. 
5. No Room for Mental Error
	1. You must be able to concentrate on your assignment and carry this out in each and every play. Mental Error is the lack of concentration and a lax attitude during the week of preparation for any game. 
	2. Concentration, Self-Pride, and Team Confidence is the best way to combat any chance of mental error. Refuse to allow anything to disturb or distract your concentration. 
6. Our Goal
	1. Prevent Touchdowns from Long Plays. 
	2. Get the ball for our Offense
	3. Have the fewest points scored against you 

Conclusion:
1. With Team Effort, Pass Defense, Desire, and no Mental Errors, we will reach our goal
2. We will repeat these points time after time until they become part of your Way of Life. 
3. Repitition may be boring, however, through this method, you will become a great defensive team.
