# Offense Scheme:
	1. The goal of the Offensive scheme is to provide a comprehensive guide to both the run and passing systems that are incorperated in the system. 
1. Run Game:
		a. The Run Game is based on a heavy dose of Gap run schemes with the occasional Zone run  scheme in which we focus on runs inside the tackles. The "Bread and Butter" Calls will primarily be Duo, Pin and Pull, Lead, and Bash with complementary runs being Inside Zone (usually paired with an option call) and Counter. The Run game should be agnostic to the Running Back 
	## Inside the 20s (Home)
			The Home 20 is also referred to as the 20 on our side of the 50 yard marker. This is the area in which we need to generate momentum to start drives. 
	## Inside the 20s (Away)
			The Away 20 is also referred to as the 20 on the opponents side of the 50 yard marker (the redzone.) This is the area in which we need to generate tempo to finish drives. 
	## Front Half 30
			The Front half 30 is the zone between our Home 20s and the 50 yard line. This is where we should expect to see the majority of our drives starting in, and should be a combination of drive starters (that can be scripted together) and tempo plays.
	## Back Half 30
			The Back Half 30 is the zone between the Away 20s and the 50 yard line. This is the largest variance area in the entire football field with respect to scoring points. In general, we should not expect to score any points past the 45 yard marker, (because the field goal attempt would be 55 yards or longer.) Should we approach the end of this zone, the greater our odds are of scoring more points before reaching the RedZone. This part of the field will be where we need to carry momentum from earlier in the drive to push deeper into the opponents side of the field.
