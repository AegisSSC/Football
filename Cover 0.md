Cover 0 is an aggressive [[Defensive Coverage]] scheme that is usually tied to [heavy blitz packages](https://weeklyspiral.com/2021/06/24/how-brian-flores-blitzes-and-tite-fronts-have-the-miami-defense-rolling/). It leaves zero deep defenders and utilizes man coverage. It’s a high risk and high reward play. The goal being to pressure the quarterback and force a sack or mistake.



## Cover 0 Philosophy

The philosophy of Cover 0 is to create as much pressure and pass protection confusion as possible to disrupt rhythm and timing throws, create a sack, or force a bad pass. While not always paired with blitz packages, Cover 0 does always have zero deep help and use man coverage. By showing all-out blitzes, the defense can force the offense into predictable situations with hot routes and pass protection rules that they can then schematically exploit. Offenses will try to combat Cover 0 with quick hitters, crossing routes, bunch formations, and deep shots.
