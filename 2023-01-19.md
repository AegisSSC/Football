Garrett Riley wants to bring more Air Raid into the Clemson system. 



"Defining my Offensive Philosophy" - Power Run + Vertical Passing
Combining Air Raid Passing concepts with Power Run to create Power Raid offense. 
Utilizing [[Gus Malzhan]] + [[Nick Saban]] Power Running Concepts with [[Hal Mumme]] + [[Mike Leech]] Passing Concepts to balance out the disadvantages of both. 

- 60-40 Pass to Run Ratio. 
- 2 to 3 Foot Splits between Offensive Linemen to give a better balance between Power and Air Raid
- Using this hybrid approach, it keeps defenses honest because they have to respect both attacks
- Has the Ability to use Passing and Rushing Attack to open up opportunities for the other. 
- Any Quick Pass can be paired with any Rush to Create an RPO
