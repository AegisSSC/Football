Cover 6 is a hybrid [[Defensive Coverage]] scheme in which [[Cover 4]] is played to the Strength of the defense, and [[Cover 2]] to the Weakside of the offense. 


Cover 6 is used to provide extra support to the field while also allowing a double team to the receiver on the weakside. 

In general, Cover 6 helps filter through a Trips set as it still has a 4 over 3 coverage






## Cover 6 Assignments

#### Corners:
-   Cover 2 Corner
    -   Hands on #1 receiver funneling them inside
    -   Sink and collect any routes that enter the flats with eyes in the backfield
    -   Must carry any vertical routes to help safety get to their deep half before reacting to the flats

-   Cover 4 Corner
    
    -   Responsible for the deep quarter of the field to their side
    
    -   If #1 goes vertical further than 10 yards in your zone, match in man coverage
    
    -   If #1 goes short or inside, get eyes on #2


#### Free Safety (Cover 2 Safety):

-   Responsible for deep half to their side
    -   The free safety is typically more athletic and better in coverage which allows them to cover more space than the strong safety (half of the field vs. a quarter of the field)
-   Split the difference between any vertical routes while protecting their deep half
-   Stay deeper than the deepest

#### Strong Safety (Cover 4 Safety):

-   Responsible for deep quarter to their side
-   If #2 goes vertical further than 10 yards in your zone, match in man coverage
-   If #2 goes short or to the flats, get eyes on #1

#### Outside Linebackers:

-   Cover 2 Linebacker
    -   Hands on #2 funneling them outside
    -   Sink and collect routes in the seam and hook zone at depth of 10-12 yards between numbers and hash
    
-   Cover 4 Linebacker
    -   Hands on #2 funneling them outside
    -   Sink and pursue to flat
        -   Cannot be out-leveraged outside

#### Middle Linebacker:
-   Wall crossers
-   Sink and collect vertical threats down the middle or get under deep crossers



## How to Break It:
The biggest weakness of Cover 6 is the same weakness in Cover 4. The Cover 4 side of the coverage struggles to get the flat defender outside fast enough without help from the corner that’s bailing to his deep quarter. That allows for teams to quickly attack the flats. To combat that issue, the defense bumps their flat defender out wide to be able to immediately occupy that space. As that player back pedals to protect the curl, though, he sees no flat routes from the #1 or #3 receiver inside and continues to carry #2 vertically. That leaves the backside (Cover 2) linebacker as the one responsible for carrying the single receiver across the field underneath. The Cover 4 linebacker has carried vertical and can’t help carry the crosser. As a result, the Bears get to the flats and are able to occupy all three Cover 4 defenders with their three receivers to that side which opens up space for a run after catch opportunity underneath.
